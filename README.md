 - oneAPI is an open, cross-architecture programming model that frees developers to use a single code base across multiple architectures. The result is accelerated  compute  without vendor lock-in.
 - The objective of this hackathon is to build solutions with oneAPI for compelling problems identified. Developers can choose to work in the themes of the ML, Computer Vision, and Open Innovation theme. The developers are expected to build the solutions using the IntelÂ® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkits.
