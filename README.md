# Multiple_Disease_Prediction
 In multiple disease prediction, it is possible to predict more than one disease at a time. Here we are taking three diseases that are:
  - Heart disease
  - Diabetes
  - Parkinson's disease

#
 - oneAPI is an open, cross-architecture programming model that frees developers to use a single code base across multiple architectures. The result is accelerated  compute  without vendor lock-in.
 - The objective of this hackathon is to build solutions with oneAPI for compelling problems identified. Developers can choose to work in the themes of the ML, Computer Vision, and Open Innovation theme. The developers are expected to build the solutions using the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkits.
 
 
# 01 Problem Statement
 - Predicting Disease Outcomes: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and 
predict the likelihood of developing certain diseases or conditions. This could include using 
Scikit-Learn to build models that can identify risk factors and make predictions about future 
health outcomes.


# 02 Setup

# 04 Implementation

  Here we are using Logistic Regression machine learning algorithm for diabetes prediction and SVM machine learning algorithm for Parkinson's disease, Heart disease prediction. The working of the SVM is as follows:
